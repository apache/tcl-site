	    <p>
	      The Apache Tcl project can always use dedicated
	      volunteers to help out with the individual projects.  If
	      you would like to contribute your Tcl/Web/Apache project
	      to the Apache Tcl group, please see the contacts page.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <b>Apache Tcl needs a logo</b>!  If you feel graphically
	      inclined, please see the contacts page and send in your
	      work.  We're looking for something that combines the Tcl
	      and Apache feathers.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If you are interested in working on or improving this
	      website, the code is available from Apache's anonymous
	      CVS.  You will need mod_dtcl, Apache Rivet, and Websh.
