	    <p>
	      The Apache Tcl project can always use dedicated
	      volunteers to help out with the individual projects.  If
	      you would like to contribute your project to Apache Tcl,
	      please see the contacts page.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <b>Apache Tcl needs a logo</b>!  If you feel graphically
	      inclined, please see the contacts page and send in your
	      work.  We're looking for something that combines the Tcl
	      and Apache feathers.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If you are interested in working on or improving this
	      website, the code is available from Apache's anonymous
	      CVS.  You will need mod_dtcl.
