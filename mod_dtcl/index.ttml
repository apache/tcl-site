	      <b>mod_dtcl</b> is an Open Source implementation of server
	      parsed Tcl, running under Apache.  It is a flexible
	      platform that allows you to integrate Tcl and HTML
	      however you choose; you can tightly interweave them,
	      in order to write powerful dynamic web pages quickly, or
	      you can also follow different programming models, such
	      as the "Model View Controller" framework, should you
	      wish to create a large, complex web system which
	      seperates content from code.

	      <a href="http://tcl.activestate.com/">Tcl</a> is a very
	      common scripting language with many years of development
	      invested in it. Because Tcl is such a widely used
	      language, there is a large amount of documentation for
	      it, both on the net and books. There are also many
	      external Tcl modules that you can load into mod_dtcl, to
	      create images, access databases, and so forth.
