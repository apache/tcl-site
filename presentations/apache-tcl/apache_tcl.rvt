    <p>
      Our projects aren't just related by the fact that we all use Tcl
      - the Apache Tcl projects share a common philosophy that "simple
      things should be easy, and hard things should be possible" (to
      borrow a quote - it works well for them!).  We all arrived at
      Tcl not because it's the only tool in our box, but because for
      us it is the right tool.
