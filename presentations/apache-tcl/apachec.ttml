    <p>
      Apache's C API is quite extensive, and merits one or more talks
      of its own, but here are a few things we have found particularly
      useful.  A big thanks to all the httpd developers!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>pools
	<ul>
	  <li>A memory management system that simplifies life a
	  lot for the module author!</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>apreq
	<ul>
	  <li>good system for dealing with user-supplied data -
	  cookies, GET and POST variables, etc...</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>apxs
	<ul>
	  <li>Useful for building extensions - gives you the compile
	  options you need to find and use the same build environment
	  as Apache.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
