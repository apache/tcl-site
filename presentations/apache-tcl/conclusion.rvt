    <p>Unfortunately, within a limited time, it's impossible to cover
    all the intricacies and possibilities that Apache and Tcl offer,
    but I hope to have shown that using these two systems lets you do
    some very powerful things.  </p>

    <p>It may not seem like it in just an hour, but Rivet is
    simple. It is less than 5000 lines of code, and yet it provides
    most of what PHP does, with easily 1/10th the code.  It does this
    by carefully reutilizing everything it can from Apache and
    Tcl.</p>

    <p>
      I hope that by showing you some of what is possible, you will be
      able to further explore, and hopefully create something new and
      interesting!
