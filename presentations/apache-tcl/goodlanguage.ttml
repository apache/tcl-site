      Tcl handles complexity just fine.  The standard Tcl library,
      tcllib has code to let you create and manage, easily, a variety
      of data structures.  Tcl is so flexible, that object orientation
      comes from a loadable package!

      There are Tcl extensions to do the things that you need to do to
      get your job done.
