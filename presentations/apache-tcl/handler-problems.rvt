    In order to create a system that is fast and easy to use that
    doesn't surprise the user, we had a few problems to solve:
    <ol>
      <li>Keep each page 'seperate' - if you set a variable in
      foo.rvt, you don't want to see it again in bar.rvt.</li>
      <li>Provide a way to share global data for those who need to
      access it.  Persistent database connections, or sockets, for
      example.</li>
      <li>
	Provide clean integration of Tcl and HTML, in order to make
	quick and dirty templating possible, and easy.
      </li>
      <li>
	Let users use 'normal' Tcl scripts.  One of the big advantages
	Tcl has (over, say, PHP) is that it is a multi-purpose
	language.  It's not restricted to just the web.  Rivet
	attempts to make it possible to take ordinary Tcl code and run
	it in Rivet without changes, which means there is more code
	available to use.
      </li>
      <li>Keep the whole system fast!</li>
    </ol>
