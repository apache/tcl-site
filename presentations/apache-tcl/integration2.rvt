    <p>
      With all of these API's to work with, uniting them has been both
      very pleasant, and not all that difficult.  In all the Rivet .c
      and .h files, there are around 5500 lines, total.  Not bad,
      considering Tcl is 150K lines, and Apache 1.3 is around 120K!

    <p>
      The ability to leverage so much power - linking together two
      different, flexible, multipurpose systems - is a testament to
      the strength and adaptability of both Tcl and Apache.
