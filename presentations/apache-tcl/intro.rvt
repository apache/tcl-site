    Apache's web server and Tcl are both very flexible systems that
    give the programmer tools to extend and modify them in
    interesting, unique and powerful ways.  We will talk about the
    many possibilities offered by Apache and Tcl's C API's, briefly
    introduce the Tcl programming language and its concept of acting
    as a command language for lower-level components, and also discuss
    some interesting aspects of integrating Apache and Tcl.
