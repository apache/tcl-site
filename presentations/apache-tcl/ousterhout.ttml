    <? prevnext "<h1>The Reasoning Behind Tcl</h1>" ?>
    <p>
      The original idea behind Tcl is still very valid today: powerful
      applications can be made much more so by letting the user access
      parts of them programmatically.  One-off languages are best
      replaced by a more general solution.  The answer: a reusable
      library that provides a scripting language.
