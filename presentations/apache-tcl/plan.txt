"Apache's web server and Tcl are both very flexible systems that give
the programmer tools to extend and modify them in interesting, unique
and powerful ways.  We will talk about the many possibilities offered
by Apache and Tcl's C API's, briefly introduce the Tcl programming
language and its concept of acting as a command language for
lower-level components, and also discuss some interesting aspects of
integrating Apache and Tcl."

*Apache Directives

*Handlers
**Connect files with code to handle them.
***This is where the 'exciting' stuff happens.

*Integrating Tcl

*Creating interpreters (ChildInit).
**Multiple interpreters for different virtual hosts.
**Set up commands in each interpreter.
**Run any ChildInit scripts.

*Tcl Handlers
**Problems:
***Keep each page 'seperate'.
***Share global data, but only if you really want to.
***Present a way to embed Tcl in HTML.
***Use 'normal' Tcl scripts.
***Speed.
**Our answers
***namespace request {}
***<? ?> parsed into 'puts' commands.
***Channel layer.
***Cacheing.
