    <p>
      Tcl stands for "Tool Command Language".  It was created in the
      late 80'ies, by John Ousterhout, then a professor at the
      University of California at Berkeley, as a replacement for the
      many small extension languages he was writing for his
      applications.  From the very beginning, Tcl was engineered to be
      combined with other systems.
