    <p>A good language is important, but if you are trying to do
    something in a hurry, you need good libraries (any Scheme fans
    here?).</p>

    <p>
      Tcl has a lot of code available!  And what's more, you can use
      it with your web-based programs (XML, database access, image
      libraries), but you can then take the same code, and use it
      elsewhere.
