    WebSH was born in 1995 as a C++ library incorporating a Tcl
    interpreter, and gradually migrated to being a Tcl extension.  It
    became Free Software in 2000, and was contributed to the ASF in
    2001.  Andrej Vckovski was the original author, with major work
    done by Ronnie Brunner (WebSH 2) and Simon Hefti (WebSH 3).
