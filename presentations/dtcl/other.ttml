    AOLserver is a very nice package which demonstrates the power of
    Tcl.  It is impressive to think that it (along with the
    proprietary StoryServer) were created in 1995, when most people
    were using Perl CGI's.  It is a complete server from the ground
    up, and so doesn't ride on Apache.  NeoWebScript, by Karl
    Lehenbauer, is similar to mod_dtcl, but does a few things
    differently, and in the future will be merged with mod_dtcl as
    'Apache Rivet'.  WebSH is another web Tcl platform that deserves
    mention, as it has been used in commercial environments for some
    time.
