      Today, we'll be talking about Apache 1.3 for the following
      reasons:

    <ul>
      <li>I know it best:-)</li>
      <li>On Unix, it works just fine.</li>
      <li>Threads are <b>complicated</b> and introduce many
      hard-to-find problems.</li>
      <li>Apache 1.3 is not going away any time soon.</li>
    </ul>

    There are some differences with 2.0, but most programmers will be
    able to pick up on them without too much trouble.
