    <? prevnext "<h1>Apache as a Platform</h1>" ?>

    <p>
      One of the biggest reasons for the Apache web server's
      popularity is that it is a "platform".
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that it provides a comprehensive API that lets you,
      as a programmer, create new applications on top of the basic
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though we won't be talking about it much, this is
      especially true of Apache 2, which can even serve other internet
      protocols.
