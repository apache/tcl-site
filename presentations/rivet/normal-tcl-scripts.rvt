    <p>
      One of the first things we faced when trying to make normal Tcl
      scripts work under Apache was the output problem: Tcl scripts
      usually send output via the "puts" command, and we didn't want
      to make programmers use a special command that only works in
      Rivet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer: we create a special "channel" driver that integrates
      Apache's I/O system with Tcl's.
