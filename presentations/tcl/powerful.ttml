    <? prevnext "<h1>Tcl is Powerful</h1>" ?>

    Tcl's power lies in its extensibility and flexibility.
    <p>
      The core language gives you a lot - and extensions give you the rest.
    <p>
    <ul>      
      <li>Object oriented programming: [incr Tcl]</li>
      <li>Web: mod_dtcl, AOLServer, tclhttpd</li>
      <li>Database: postgresql, oracle, mysql, etc...</li>
      <li>Data structures: graphs, trees</li>
      <li>Testing: tcltest</li>
      <li>System Administration: expect, scotty (SNMP)</li>
      <li>Unix facilities: TclX</li>
    </ul>

    Tcl is fast - it's byte compiled at run time, like Python.  It
    also has a lot of high level things that you would expect in a
    scripting language - lists, hash tables, easy to use socket
    commands, etc...
