    But that's only the beginning... now we look at the Tk toolkit.
<p>
Ousterhout realized that some of the same scripting concepts that
applied to Tcl applied to graphical toolkits as well - you can make
the pieces in a low level language like C, and then fit them together
with a scripting language.  This makes it very quick to develop
graphical applications.  And thus was born the Tk toolkit for the Tcl
scripting language...
