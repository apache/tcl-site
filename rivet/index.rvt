	      <b>Apache Rivet</b> is a powerful, flexible, consistent,
	      fast, and robust solution to creating web applications:
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <b>Powerful</b>: Apache Rivet puts the Tool Command
	      Language in the hands of the programmer, allowing him or
	      her to manipulate data easily and concisely.  Millions
	      of lines of Tcl code already exist - all you have to do
	      is glue them together to create unique and useful
	      applications.  Rivet unites this power with the Apache
	      web server.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <b>Flexible</b>: The original design constraints for Tcl
	      required that it be flexible enough to be inserted and
	      function in an extreme variety of environments.  That's
	      still true today, and makes Tcl, and as a consequence,
	      Apache Rivet, easy to integrate into your business to
	      leverage existing systems.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <b>Consistent</b>: The Tool Command Language is
	      integrated with Apache Rivet in such a way as to provide
	      you with an easy-to-learn interface that won't surprise
	      you.  Because of this, you can use the same, elegant
	      programming language for your web applications, GUI's
	      (with the Tk toolkit), and quick'n'dirty system
	      administration tasks.  Very simple!
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <b>Fast</b>: A dedicated team of programmers works to
	      make sure Apache Rivet locks in tightly with both Tcl
	      and Apache, ensuring that you get as much performance as
	      your hardware can handle.  Where you need to squeeze out
	      the last bit of speed, the Tool Command Language
	      provides you with a high-quality C API which lets you
	      write Tcl extensions in no time.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <b>Robust</b>: Created in the late 80'ies by
	      U.C. Berkeley professor John Ousterhout, Tcl has stood
	      the test of time, being used in such notable companies
	      as IBM, Oracle, Cisco, AOL, and many, many others.
	      There is a core group of maintainers who oversee the
	      development and maintainance of the Tool Command
	      Language, so that it continues to improve, yet maintains
	      its rock-solid nature.
