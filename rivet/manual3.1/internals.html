      This section easily falls out of date, as new code is added, old
      code is removed, and changes are made.  The best place to look
      is the source code itself.  If you are interested in the changes
      themselves, the Subversion revision control system
      (<span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span></span>) can provide you with information about
      what has been happening with the code.

    		The Apache HTTP web server has an extremely modular architecture
    		that made it very popular among web developers. Most of the server
    		features can be implemented in external modules, including some of
    		the way the server interfaces to the operative system. The multiprocessing
    		modules are meant to provide different models for distributing the
    		server workload but also to cope with different operative systems
    		having their specific architectures and services.
    	</p><p style="width:90%">
    		From the very beginning mod_rivet was designed to work with
    		the  <a class="ulink" href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/prefork.html" target="_top">prefork MPM</a>
    		MPM (Multi Processing Module) which assumes the OS to have 'fork' capabilities.
    		This prerequisite basically restricted mod_rivet to work only with
    		Unix-like operative systems. Starting with version 3.0 we reorganized
    		mod_rivet to offer a design that could work together with more MPM and
    		hopefully pave the way to support different OS that have no 'fork'
    		call. At the same time we tried to preserve some of the basic
    		features of mod_rivet when working with the prefork MPM, chiefly the feature of
    		the Unix fork system call of 'cloning' a parent process
    		memory into its child, thus allowing fast initialization of interpreters.
    	</p><p style="width:90%">
    		The central design of mod_rivet now relies on the idea of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">MPM bridges</span>”</span>,
    		loadable modules that are responsible to adapt the module procedural design to
    		a given class of Apache MPMs. This design is open to the development of more
    		MPM bridges coping with different multi-processing models but also to the development of
    		different approaches to resource consumption and workload balance. Currently we have 3 bridges: 
    	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">rivet_prefork_mpm.c: a bridge for the prefork MPM</li><li class="listitem">rivet_worker_mpm.c: a threaded bridge creating a pool of threads
    		each running Tcl interpreters and communicating with the worker MPM threads

    		started <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">on demand</span>”</span>. The bridge creates no threads and Tcl interpreters
    		at start up and only when requests come in Tcl execution threads are created.
    		This bridge is explained in detail in the <a class="xref" href="lazybridge.html" title="Example: the “Lazy” bridge">the section called “Example: the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Lazy</span>”</span> bridge”</a>.     		
    		Since the resource demand at startup is minimal this bridge should suit
    		development machines that go through frequent web server restarts.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm4387"></a>mod_rivet MPM Bridge callbacks</h3></div></div></div><p style="width:90%">
    		A bridge is a loadable library implementing different ways to handle
    		specific features needed to mod_rivet. It was originally meant as a way
    		to handle the prefork/worker/event MPM specificities that prevented mod_rivet
    		from supporting each of them, at the same time avoiding the need to stuff the 
    		code with conditional statements that would have implied useless complexity (an
    		instance of the Apache web server can run only an MPM at a time), 
    		error prone programming and performance costs. 
    		New bridges could be imagined also to implement different models of workload
    		and resource management (like the resources demanded by the Tcl interpreters). 
			We designed an interface between the core of mod_rivet and its MPM bridges 
			based on a set of functions defined in the rivet_bridge_table structure.

					to requests creating content, thus whatever it is
					a content generating function must exist (during the early stages of
					development you can create a simple test function for that). In a
					threaded MPM this function typically prepares the request processing 
					stuffing somewhere the pointer to the request_rec structure 
					passed by the web server and then it calls some method to communicate
					these data to the Tcl execution thread waiting for result to be

					signaling the threads to exit). The <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>::rivet::exit</strong></span></span>

			if the variable is actually persistant between pages.  The

            Rivet endows the Tcl interpreter with new commands
            serving as interface between the application layer and the
            Apache web server. Many of these commands
            are meaningful only when a HTTP request is under way and 
            therefore a request_rec object allocated by the framework 
            is existing and was passed to mod_rivet as argument of a callback. 
            In case commands have to gain access to a valid request_rec
            object the C procedure must check if such 
            a pointer exists and it's initialized
            with valid data. For this purpose the procedure handling requests 
            (Rivet_SendContent) makes a copy of such pointer and keeps it
            in an internal structure. The copy is set to NULL just before
            returning to the framework, right after mod_rivet's has
            carried out its request processing. When the pointer copy is NULL 
            the module is outside any request processing and this
            condition invalidates the execution of
            many of the Rivet commands. In case they are called  
            (for example in a ChildInitScript, GlobalInitScript, 
            ServerInitScript or ChildExitScript) they fail with a Tcl error 
            you can handle with a <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>catch</strong></span></span> command.

            For this purpose in src/rivet.h the macro
            CHECK_REQUEST_REC was defined accepting two arguments: the thread
				private data object and the command name. If the pointer is NULL
            the macro calls Tcl_NoRequestRec and returns TCL_ERROR
            causing the command to fail. These are the steps to follow

			If you are interested in hacking on Rivet, you're welcome to
			contribute!  Invariably, when working with code, things go
			wrong, and it's necessary to do some debugging.  In a server
			environment like Apache, it can be a bit more difficult to
			find the right way to do this.  Here are some techniques to
			try.
      </p><p style="width:90%">
			The first thing you should know is that Apache can be launched
			as a <span class="emphasis"><em>single process</em></span> with the
			-X argument:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">httpd -X</pre>.

		<p style="width:90%">
			On Linux, one of the first things to try is the system call
			tracer, <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>strace</strong></span></span>.  You don't even have to
			recompile Rivet or Apache for this to work.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">strace -o /tmp/outputfile -S 1000 httpd -X</pre><p style="width:90%">
      	This command will run httpd in the system call tracer,
			which leaves its output (there is potentially a lot of it) in
			<code class="filename">/tmp/outputfile</code>.  The -S
			option tells <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong></strong></span></span>strace to only record the
			first 1000 bytes of a syscall.  Some calls such as
			<code class="function">write</code> can potentially be much longer than
			this, so you may want to increase this number.  The results
			are a list of all the system calls made by the program.  You
			want to look at the end, where the failure presumably occured,
			to see if you can find anything that looks like an error.  If
			you're not sure what to make of the results, you can always
			ask on the Rivet development mailing list.
      </p><p style="width:90%">
			If <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>strace</strong></span></span> (or its equivalent on your
			operating system) doesn't answer your question, it may be time
			to debug Apache and Rivet.  To do this, you will need to rebuild mod_rivet.
			First of all you have to configure the build by running the
			<span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>./configure</strong></span></span> script with the
			-enable-symbols option and after you have
			set the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables
      </p><pre class="programlisting">export CFLAGS="-g -O0"
export LDFLAGS="-g"
./configure --enable-symbols ......
make
make install</pre><p style="width:90%">
			Arguments to <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>./configure</strong></span></span> must fit your Apache HTTP
			web server installation. See the output produced by
		</p><pre class="programlisting">./configure --help</pre><p style="width:90%">
			And check the <a class="xref" href="installation.html" title="Apache Rivet 3.1 Installation">the section called “Apache Rivet 3.1 Installation”</a> page to
			have further information.
			Since it's easier to debug a single process, we'll still run
			Apache in single process mode with -X:
