            Apache Rivet devolves to the <a class="ulink" href="" target="_top">Multi-Processing Module (MPM)</a>
            the task of managing the agents responding to network requests. 
            An MPM is responsible for creating such agents during the start-up, 
            and is in charge for terminating existing ones and recreating new 
            agents when the workload is requiring it. 
       </p><p style="width:90%">
            Apache Rivet 2.x supported only the
            <a class="ulink" href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/prefork.html" target="_top">prefork</a>
            MPM which creates child processes as independent agents responding to network requests. 
            Starting with 3.0 also the <a class="ulink" href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/worker.html" target="_top">worker</a> and
            <a class="ulink" href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/event.html" target="_top">event</a> MPM are supported. The worker MPM is
            an hybrid model where forked child processes in turn create threads as real
            network agents. Also Apache on Windows© is now supported and tested
            with the <a class="ulink" href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mpm_winnt.html" target="_top">winnt</a> MPM, 
            where a single process creates and manages a large number of thread agents.

               Apaches starts up as a single process. During this stage Apache performs 
               various preliminary tasks including reading and parsing the configuration. 
					After the configuration has been read Rivet sets up some internal resources
					and if a Tcl script is set as argument of a <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>ServerInitScript</strong></span></span>

					Variables, arrays or dictionaries created during 
					the execution of this script will be preserved and later replicated in the 
					child process intepreters if the prefork MPM is loaded (which restricts
					this feature to the Unix systems). 
					The prefork MPM creates new child processes with a fork() 
					system call, which involves only in memory copy of sections of a
					process address space. Tcl is careful about reproducing an environment
					across a fork call in order to have a functional interpreter.

                 After a child has been initialized it's ready to serve requests. 
                 A child process' lifetime is almost entirely spent in this phase, waiting
                 for connections and responding to requests. At every request the URL 
                 goes through filter processing and, in case, rewritten
                 (mod_rewrite, Alias directives, etc). 
                 Parameter values encoded in the request are made available to the 
                 environment and finally the script encoded in the URL is run. 
                 The developer can tell Rivet if optionally the execution has to
                 be  preceded by a <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>BeforeScript</strong></span></span> and followed by an
                 <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>AfterScript</strong></span></span>. The real script mod_rivet will
                 execute is the result of the concatenation of the 
                 <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>BeforeScript</strong></span></span>,
                 the script encoded in the URL and the <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>AfterScript</strong></span></span>.
                 Thus the whole ensemble of code that makes up a web application might
                 be running within the same "before" and "after" scripts to which 
                 the programmer can devolve tasks common to every 
                 page of an application.

                 If no error condition forces the child process to a premature exit, his
                 life is determined by the Apache configuration parameters. To reduce
                 the effects of memory leaks in buggy applications the Apache webserver 
                 forces a child process to exit after a
                 certain number of requests served. A child process gets replaced 
                 with a brand new one if the workload of webserver requires so. 
                 Before the process quits an exit handler can be run
                 to do some housekeeping, just in case something the could have been 
                 left behind has to be cleaned up. Like the initialization scripts
                 <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>ChildExitScript</strong></span></span> too is a "one shot" script.

                 to run more Tcl scripts. The child process then is forced
                 to exit and be replaced by a new one when the workload demands it.

         Rivet is highly configurable and each of the webserver lifecycle stages 
         can be exploited to control a web application. 
         Not only the orderly sequence of stages
         in a child lifecycle can be controlled with Tcl scripts, but also
         Tcl error or abnormal conditions taking place during
         the execution can be caught and handled with specific scripts.
       </p><p style="width:90%">
	    	Tcl errors (conditions generated when a command exits with code TCL_ERROR) 
	    	usually result in the printing of a backtrace of the code fragment

	    	Rivet can set up scripts to trap these errors and run instead
	    	an <span style="font-family:monospace"><span class="command"><strong>ErrorScript</strong></span></span> to handle it and conceal details
	    	that usually have no interest for the end user and it

			With the sole exception of .rvt templates, mod_rivet runs pure Tcl scripts 
			at the global namespace. That means that every variable or procedure 
			created in Tcl scripts resides by default in the 
			"::" namespace (just like in traditional Tcl scripting) and they
			are persistent across different requests until explicitly unset or
			until the interpreter is deleted.
			You can create your own application namespaces to store data but
			it is important to remember that subsequent requests will in general be served 
			by different child processes. Your application can rely on the fact that 
			certain application data will be in the interpreter, but you shouldn't 
			assume the state of a transaction spanning several pages 
			can be stored in this way and be safely kept available to a 
			specific client. Sessions exist for this purpose and Rivet ships its own 
			session package with support for most of popular DBMS. Nonetheless 
			storing data in the global namespace can be useful, even though scoping 
			data in a namespace is recommended. I/O channels and
			database connections are examples of information usually specific 
			to a process for which you don't want to pay the overhead of creating them
			at every request, probably causing a dramatic loss in the application
			performance.

			create variables or object instances in template files and foresake about them: Rivet
			will take care of cleaning the namespace up and everything created inside the namespace
			will be destroyed.
