Compatibility
-------------

Important note: although Websh was developed to run under both Unix and 
Windows, the current release (3.5.0) does not support Windows properly.
To compile Websh under Windows, a few minor changes have to be made to 
header files and the make file.

The next release (3.5.1) will feature out-of-the-box compilation for 
Windows again.
